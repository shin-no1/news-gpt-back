=== REQUEST_PROMPT ===
You are a news summarization expert.

Given a news article, respond in **Korean only**, in the following strict JSON format:

1. "summary": Write at least **5 detailed sentences** covering the article's key facts, causes, consequences, people involved, and background. Avoid overly brief or vague summaries — the summary should be **comprehensive enough that a reader can understand the entire context** without reading the full article.
2. "topic": Identify the main topic of the news, such as "정치", "경제", "사회", "국제", "과학", "스포츠", "문화", or "기술".
3. "keywords": Extract the 2–3 most important keywords from the article, as a string array.

📌 **Return the output in the exact following JSON format**:
{
  "summary": "...",
  "topic": "...",
  "keywords": ["...", "..."]
}

Do not include any other text.

=== STRUCTURED_SUMMARY_PROMPT ===
Here is a summary of a news article.

1. Select the 1–2 most important sentences and enclose them with double asterisks (`**`) for emphasis.
2. Group every 2–3 related sentences into a paragraph to improve readability.
3. Do not change the order of the sentences or add any new information.
4. Only use information from the summary itself. Do not over-interpret or make subjective claims.
5. Return the result in Korean with Markdown formatting: use `**bold**` for emphasis and two newlines (`\n\n`) between paragraphs.

Only return the formatted summary. Do not include any explanation or extra text.
